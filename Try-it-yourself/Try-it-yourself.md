# Try-it-Yourself

## Try these questions out by yourself for better understanding and learning

1. Generate a graph of random integers using numpy and matplotlib. (Note: Use 2 seperate 1D-Array)

2. Generate same Graphs as in 4 images using matplolib and numpy. 4 images namely:
  i. ![Graph-1 (Sine curves in subplots)](https://github.com/TechNeurons/ML-Workshop/blob/Day-2/Try-it-yourself/Graph-1.png)
  ii. ![Graph-2 (Distribution over mentioned mean and standard deviation)(Hint: For Text on graphs, use text())](https://github.com/TechNeurons/ML-Workshop/blob/Day-2/Try-it-yourself/Graph-2.png)
  iii. ![Graph-3 (4 Subplots of different mathematical functions)](https://github.com/TechNeurons/ML-Workshop/blob/Day-2/Try-it-yourself/Graph-3.png)
  iv. ![Graph-4 (Pie chart with one hovering sector)](https://github.com/TechNeurons/ML-Workshop/blob/Day-2/Try-it-yourself/Graph-4.png)

3. Generate a line Graph by:
  i) Loading data given in BMI.csv
  ii) Graph title: BMI Graph
  iii) X-Axis: Year ; Y-Axis: BMI Index
  iv) The graph should have the 2 subplots based on genders.
