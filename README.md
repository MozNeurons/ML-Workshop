# Machine Learning Workshop Series

## Day 1 Contents

* Day 1 :
  * Python overview with cheatsheets
  * Library Basics:
    * Numpy

## Summary

### Cheat-Sheet Revision

* The cheat sheet provided are for reference to the python language.
* The sheets have various constructs and syntax for the language.
  * They will be useful in making the ML programs.
  * The sequence to understand and revise concepts of python are:
    * [Basic Syntax](https://github.com/TechNeurons/ML-Workshop/blob/Day-1/Basic_Syntax.jpg)
    * [Python 3 Basics](https://github.com/TechNeurons/ML-Workshop/blob/Day-1/Python_3_Basics.png)
    * [Python 3 Container Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/TechNeurons/ML-Workshop/blob/Day-1/Python_3_Container_Cheat_Sheet.jpg)
    * [Basic Example of python with explanation](https://github.com/TechNeurons/ML-Workshop/blob/Day-1/Basic_Example_of_python_with_explanation.png)
    * [Differences between Python 2 and Python 3](https://github.com/TechNeurons/ML-Workshop/blob/Day-1/Differences_between_Python2_and_Python3.png)

    * [Syntax Info Cheatsheet](https://github.com/TechNeurons/ML-Workshop/blob/Day-1/Syntax_Info_Cheatsheet.jpg)

### [Numpy](https://www.numpy.org/doc/1.17/reference/index.html) Library

* Numpy library is used for Scientific and statistical calculations with it's powerful data container: [ndarray](https://www.numpy.org/doc/1.17/reference/arrays.ndarray.html).

* The functions used for basic implementation o simple ML algorithms are discussed in the [numpy_ex.py](./numpy_ex.py) file.

* For reference, look up the documentation of [Numpy](https://www.numpy.org/doc/1.17/reference/index.html) here.
