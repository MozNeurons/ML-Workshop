# Machine Learning Workshop Series

## Day 2 Contents

* Day 2 :
  * Library Basics:
    * Matplotlib
    * Pandas

## Summary
  
### [Matplotlib Library](https://matplotlib.org/)

* Matplotlib library is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython shells, the Jupyter notebook, web application servers, and four graphical user interface toolkits.

* Matplotlib library is used for data visualisation for human verification of efficiency of algorithm

* Content covered in workshop: [Matplotlib](./Matplotlib.ipynb)

* [Matplotlib documentation reference](https://matplotlib.org/api/index.html)

### [Pandas Library](https://pandas.pydata.org/index.html)

* Pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.

* Content covered in workshop: [Pandas](./pandas_ex.py)

* Pandas is highly used for it's data structure : [DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/frame.html)

* [Pandas Documentation Reference](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/index.html)
