      - Numpy

# Summary
  ### Cheat-Sheets
  * The cheat sheet provided are for reference to the python language.
  * The sheets have various constructs and syntax for the language.
  * They will be useful in making the ML programs.
  * The sequence to understand and revise concepts of python are:

  ### [Numpy](https://www.numpy.org/doc/1.17/reference/index.html) Library

  * Numpy library is used for Scientific and statistical calculations with it's powerful data container: [ndarray](https://www.numpy.org/doc/1.17/reference/arrays.ndarray.html).

  * The functions used for basic implementation o simple ML algorithms are discussed in the [numpy_ex.py](./numpy_ex.py) file.

  * For more reference, look up the documentation of [Numpy](https://www.numpy.org/doc/1.17/reference/index.html) here.
