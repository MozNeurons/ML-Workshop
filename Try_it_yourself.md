# TRY IT YOURSELF

1. Analyse the K-means Algorithm output of jain.tsv and Distribtion-1.csv for different pre-defined centroids.
(i.e. Take the initial centroid values from the dataset other than the first 3 data points as done in the designed algorithm k-means)

2. Plot the following tsv files:
    * Aggregation.tsv
    * Compund.tsv
    * D31.tsv
    * flame.tsv
    * pathbased.tsv
    * R15.tsv
    * spiral.tsv

3. Cluster data from 'books.csv' into something deducible

4. Cluster data from 'CC General.csv' into something deducible

5. Cluster data from 'wine.csv' into something deducible

6. Try to replace euclidean distance formula with manhattan distance formula in the designed K-means algorithm

7. Executing the K-means clustering in a loop, look up the different figures generated for different cluster numbers
(i.e., uncomment the line below the definition of cluster_num and Execute everything in a loop until the cluster_num == 0)
